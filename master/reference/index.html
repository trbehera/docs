<tbody>
<tr>
<td>API</td>
<td>Acronym - Application Programming Interface. An Application Programming Interface is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Application Whitelisting</td>
<td>Term - Application whitelisting is the practice of specifying an index of approved software applications that are permitted to be present and active on a computer system. The goal of whitelisting is to protect computers and networks from potentially harmful applications. A minimum IoT Security best practice to allow an explicit, limited list of applications to run on an IoT Device. Compare to Anti-Virus which blacklists known bad applications to disallow their execution, but only (long) after they have been discovered to be bad. Whitelisting disallows ALL applications, except those known good ones on the IoT Device’s Whitelist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Board or System OEM</td>
<td>Term - An IoT Device manufacturer (OEM/ODM) who designs the hardware &amp; software, assembles a board and/or system using a processor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CA</td>
<td>Acronym - Certificate Authority. In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client</td>
<td>Term – Secure Device Onboard code that implements the Secure Device Onboard Ownership transfer within an IoT Device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CoAP</td>
<td>Acronym - Constrained Application Protocol. A specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>COS</td>
<td>Acronym - Code Origination Scan. An audit process for software code. Run on created software that may be using open source code or samples. It allows companies to properly attribute all code snippets and usage to the correct owners as well as any hazardous code usage. The code scan is a discovery process that removes uncertainties around IP ownership.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-signed Ownership Voucher</td>
<td>Term - The Ownership Voucher can be extended by each entity in the supply chain that legally and physically possesses/owns the IoT Device on the way to its ultimate Owner. The counter-signing is accomplished electronically by adding a subsequent signature to the (counter-signed) Ownership Voucher received from the previous possessor in the Supply Chain – without having to open the shipping container and without powering the IoT Device on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CRL</td>
<td>Certificate Revocation List</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CSP</td>
<td>Acronym - Cloud Service Provider. A cloud provider is a company that offers some component of cloud computing – typically Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) – to other businesses or individuals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CSR</td>
<td>Acronym - Certificate Signing Request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DAA</td>
<td>Acronym - Direct Anonymous Attestation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device</td>
<td>A gateway, microprocessor, or microcontroller that is capable of sending information via a network protocol such as HTTP or Bluetooth® and is enabled with Secure Device Onboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device Credentials</td>
<td>Term - The Ownership data embedded in an Secure Device Onboard enabled-device used to establish Trust with an IOT Platform Service by proving the authenticity of the Ownership Voucher presented by the Secure Device Onboard Owner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device GUID</td>
<td>Term/Acronym - Device Global Unique Identification. A Globally Unique ID that is a not-easily guessable ID that is generally randomly generated and sparsely populated within a large set of possible values. It is embedded in the IoT Device, included in the Ownership Voucher and printed on the outside of the shipping container. It is used to extend the Ownership Voucher without opening the shipping container and to identify an IoT Device within the Secure Device Onboard service as an index for the rendezvous between the IoT Platform Service and the IoT Device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device Management Agent</td>
<td>Term - Code that runs on an IoT Device to provide the normal, day-to-day, minute-to-minute interaction with the Device Management Service after the IoT Device is onboarded. The agent can be distributed with the Secure Device Onboard device, or downloaded to the Device during Secure Device Onboard onboarding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device Management Service</td>
<td>Term - Back end service used by customer that ultimately will take ownership-on-behalf-of an IoT Device to manage services, security or access. Can include Cloud Service Provider (CSP), Identity and Access Management platform (IAM), IoT Platform Management services (like Building Management Services (BMS), Oil and Gas platform management services, etc.) and other Independent Software Vendors (ISV). The Secure Device Onboard Owner functions are implemented within the Device Management Service to accomplish the Secure Device Onboard ownership transfer on behalf of the service in the legal owner’s account.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHKEX</td>
<td>Acronym - Diffie-Hellman Key EXchange protocol. A method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. The protocol is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange that is implemented within the field of cryptography.</td>
