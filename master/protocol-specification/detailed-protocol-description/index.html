<h1 id="detailed-protocol-description">Detailed Protocol Description<a class="headerlink" href="#detailed-protocol-description" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>This section defines protocol messages and interactions. Protocol message names
match the table, in section <a href="../data-transmission-persistence/#message-types">§</a>: Message Types*.</p>
<p>The notation for each message is based on JavaScript* Object Notation (JSON).
The message is presented as a message header and a JSON* object as body. The body
uses comments to indicate the meaning of particular JSON* elements.</p>
<p>Note that these comments and the whitespace are <em>illegal to be transmitted</em>
within the JSON* encoding described in section <a href="../protocol-description/#json-distinguished-encoding">§</a>, and are provided for
explanation only.</p>
<p>Composite types described in the tables in section <a href="../data-transmission-persistence/#message-types">§</a> are used freely. These
are also expanded out in some cases, to allow comments on the internal members.
In this case, the opening bracket should contain a comment to indicate the
composite type.</p>
<h2 id="general-messages">General Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#general-messages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="error-type-255">Error - Type 255<a class="headerlink" href="#error-type-255" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Message Body:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{ #Error message body
    &quot;ec&quot;: Uint16, # Error code
    &quot;emsg&quot;: UInt8, # Message ID of the previous message
    &quot;em&quot;: String # Error string
}
</code></pre>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>
<p>The error message indicates that the previous protocol message could not be
processed. The error message is described in detail in section ‎<a href="../data-transmission-persistence/#error-message">§</a>.</p>
<h2 id="persisted-messages">Persisted Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#persisted-messages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Persisted messages are messages that are stored on non-volatile media and
retrieved later. They may also be transmitted outside of the Secure Device Onboard
protocols, such as in e-mail messages, and act as an interchange format.</p>
<p>Since all Secure Device Onboard messages are printable ASCII, persisted messages may be
generated and parsed in exactly the same way as transmitted messages, with only
their message type to distinguish them as persisted.</p>
<p>Persisted messages always contain the JSON* 4-element sequence encapsulation, as
described in section <a href="../data-transmission-persistence/#transmission-of-messages-over-a-stream-protocol-and-persisted-messages">§</a>.</p>
<p>The 4-element JSON* encapsulation always appears for these messages when they are
stored. For example, if the PM.PublicKey type’s body is the 16 characters:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{&quot;pk&quot;:[0,0,[0]]}
</code></pre>

<p>(This is a null public key, not very useful.)</p>
<p>Then the persisted message will actually be:</p>
<pre><code class="json">[&quot;001d&quot;,4,7,{&quot;pk&quot;:[0,0,[0]]}]
</code></pre>

<p>Where the “001d” in the 4-character length field indicates that the entire
message is 29 bytes (=0x1d) long.</p>
<h3 id="pmcredowner-type-1">PM.CredOwner, Type 1<a class="headerlink" href="#pmcredowner-type-1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Stored in Device TEE</p>
<p>This is the Ownership Credential that is stored in the device TEE during the
Device Initialize Protocol (DI), and updated in Transfer Ownership 2 Protocol
(TO2).</p>
<p>Message Body:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{ # OwnerBlock
    &quot;pv&quot;: UInt16,
    &quot;pe&quot;: UInt8,
    &quot;g&quot;: Guid,
    &quot;r&quot;: RendezvousInfo,
    &quot;pkh&quot;: Hash
}
</code></pre>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>
<p>The “pv” parameter specifies the protocol version as a UInt16, in the same
format as the message header. The protocol version must be persisted whether the
message header information is available or not (For example, in the Device TEE).</p>
<p>The “pe” parameter specifies the key encoding used in this credential, and in
ownership proxies based on this credential.</p>
<p>The GUID parameter “g” is the current device GUID, to be used for the next
ownership transfer.</p>
<p>The RendezvousInfo parameter “r” contains instructions on how to find the Secure
Device Onboard Rendezvous Server.</p>
<p>The Public Key Hash “pkh” is a hash of the Owner’s public key, which must match
the first entry of the Ownership Voucher used to transfer ownership for this
device. The recommended default hash to use is SHA-256 (Secure Device Onboard 1.0 &amp; Secure Device Onboard 1.1 protocol spec; SHA-384 for future crypto).</p>
<h3 id="pmcredmfg-type-2">PM.CredMfg, Type 2<a class="headerlink" href="#pmcredmfg-type-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Stored in Device TEE:</p>
<p>This is the Manufacturing Credential that is stored in the device TEE during the
Device Initialize Protocol (DI). It is never changed afterwards.</p>
<p>Message Body:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{ # ManufacturerBlock
    &quot;d&quot;: String
}
</code></pre>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>
<p>The DeviceInfo parameter “d” is the manufacturer’s DeviceInfo field. This may be
used to identify the device model.</p>
<h3 id="pmownershipproxy-type-3">PM.OwnershipProxy, Type 3<a class="headerlink" href="#pmownershipproxy-type-3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The [Ownership Voucher] (previously called as Ownership
Proxy) is used to convey the trust of the device in the factory to the new
owner.</p>
<p>The OwnershipProxy structure is shown in Table ‎1:</p>

<p>The Device Initialize Protocol (DI) serves to set the manufacturer and owner of
the device in the TEE. It is assumed to be performed at device manufacture time.</p>
<p>This protocol uses a Trust On First Use (TOFU) trust model, consistent with the
Secure Device Onboard assumption that the manufacturing environment is trusted.</p>
<p>It would be possible to implement a more restricted trust model for the DI
Protocol by embedding a public key into the TEE, with the TEE owner providing
signing (or at least CA) services to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The DI Protocol runs between a manufacturing support station, which contains the
Secure Device Onboard Manufacturing Component, and the Device TEE.</p>
<p>The Device is assumed to be running with some other kind of support software,
which is able to access the TEE and provide communications services for it. For
example, the device may be PXE-booted into a RAM-based Linux* system, with
features to access the TEE. It is assumed that this software is able to
determine from its environment the IP address for the manufacturing support

<p>The manufacturing station sends credentials to the Device TEE. The credentials
in "oh" are identical to the “oh” field of the Ownership Voucher (see section <a href="#pmownershipproxy-type-3">§</a>). Some
additional credentials allow the original manufacturer of the device to be
determined across future ownership transfers.</p>
<p>When the device uses ECDSA method for device attestation, the manufacturing
station will compute the Hash of the device certificate chain (provided by the
manufacturer to the manufacturing tool) and include the Hash as “oh.hdc” in the
message. When the device uses Intel<sup>®</sup> EPID root of trust, this field must not be
present.</p>
<p>The manufacturing station typically will use the “m” tag (see section <a href="#diappstart-type-10">§</a>) to determine
information for “oh.r,” “oh.d” and “oh.pk.” The “oh.g” field (GUID) shall be a
secure-randomly created unique identifier and not derived in any way from
device-specific information to ensure the privacy of the protocol. The Device
TEE allocates a secret, stores this information in the Device TEE as
PM.DeviceCredentials, along with the secret. The public key oh.pk is stored as a
hash of the public key oh.pk. The Device does not have to use the persisted
message format for PM.DeviceCredentials, as long as the information can be
accurately retrieved on demand.</p>
<p>The Device TEE also computes an HMAC based on the above secret and the entire
contents of this message body (including the brace brackets). This HMAC is used

TO0.AcceptOwner.ws. After the negotiated wait time passes, the owner must re-run
the TO0 Protocol to refresh its mapping.</p>
<p>The Ownership Voucher is given in “to0d.op” as a single object. The Ownership
Voucher must have at least one entry, such as, to0d.op.bo.sz &gt; 0, or the
Rendezvous Service must drop the connection.<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">1</a></sup> The Rendezvous Service may

<p>It is preferred that the Rendezvous Service has a basis on which to trust at
least one public key within the Ownership Voucher. For example, the manufacturer
who ran the DI protocol to configure the Device, thereby choosing the Rendezvous
Service, may register key hashes with the Rendezvous Service to establish such a
trust. The Owner may register its own keys additionally, or as an alternative.
An intermediate signer of the Ownership Voucher might act as a national point of
entry, using its keys to establish trust for devices in the Rendezvous Service
as they arrive in country.</p>
<p>A given Rendezvous Service may choose to reject Ownership Proxies that are not
trusted.</p>
<p>If the Rendezvous Service has no basis on which to trust the Ownership Voucher,
it must apply its own internal policies to protect itself against a DoS attack,
but may otherwise safely provide the Rendezvous Service (that is, it can allow the
TO0 and TO1 Protocols to succeed). This behavior is acceptable because the TO2
Protocol is able to verify the to1d “blob” defined in this message. However,
such a Rendezvous Service must ensure that untrusted Ownership Proxies cannot
degrade the service for trusted Ownership Proxies. This may be accomplished
through hard limiting of resources, or even allocating a trusted- and
non-trusted version of the service.</p>
<p>The Rendezvous Server needs to verify that the signature on this message is
verified by the public key on the last message of the ownership voucher, such as
by saving the public key transmitted and verifying it is the same public key.</p>
<p>In case of ECDSA device attestation method, Rendezvous Service must verify the
binding of the certificate to the Ownership Voucher (verify the certificate
chain hash). It is the only non-owner entity which can do this. It is
recommended that the Service should also do revocation check for the certificate
chain.</p>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>

WaitSeconds may not exceed NewOwnerHello.waitSeconds, but it may be less.</p>
<p>If the GUID indicated in:</p>

<p>If the new Owner does not receive a Transfer Ownership connection from a Device
within waitSeconds seconds, it must repeat Transfer Ownership Protocol 0 and
re-register its GUID to address association.</p>
<p>When the new Owner is actively changing its address from time to time (For example, to
mask its identity), the frequency of changing address dictates the magnitude of
WaitSeconds. Otherwise, the negotiation depends on the frequency at which the

remember many GUID associations.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

the TO2 Protocol). Thus the Rendezvous Server may arrange to keep the

may establish trust with the new Owner by connecting to it, using the TO2
Protocol.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Transfer Ownership Protocols 0 and 1 serve only to get the Device the IP
addressing information for a potential Owner candidate—no trust is conveyed
in these protocols.</p>
</div>
<p>When possible, the TO1 Protocol should arrive at the Rendezvous service under
HTTPS to protect the privacy of the Owner. It is possible that intermediate
stages of the protocol are run under HTTP, such as from a sensor to a gateway or
from a management engine to an OS user process.</p>
<p>If it is NOT possible to use HTTPS to protect the TO1 Protocol, the Owner may
also take measures to protect its privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Owner may use a private IP address (For example, IPv6 privacy address) and
    refresh the address periodically, to make it more difficult for an attacker
    to glean information from the rendezvous address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Owner may use a multi-tenant model, where the actual Owner of the Device
    does not relate to the IP address or DNS name of the Owner.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Device communicates with the Owner Client based on the values in the
[TO1.SDORedirect] message.</p>
<p>The TO2 Protocol is the most complicated of the protocols in Secure Device Onboard, because it has several steps that are not present in other protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishes trust in both directions: The Device uses its device attestation
    key and the Owner uses the Ownership Voucher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates an encrypted channel, based on the above trust, using a supported
    key exchange mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchanges device service info for owner service info.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Owner replaces all Secure Device Onboard credentials in the Device
    (this does not include the Device’s hardware root of trust); the Device
    gives the Owner an HMAC that allows it to generate a replacement Ownership
    Voucher. The Owner can use this new Ownership Voucher in future Secure Device Onboard
    transactions (For example, to resell the Device).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in all these operations, all unbounded data items are divided
across multiple messages, to limit the size of an HTTP transaction that the
Device is required to process (ideally, each message fits into a single packet;
this is not guaranteed at present). This causes several loops in the protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Ownership Voucher is transmitted header first, then entry by entry in
    successive messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service info (in each direction) is transmitted in as many messages as
    necessary to keep the message size to a single packet. A constrained device
    may assume that the connection MTU size is 1500 bytes. The Owner should try
    to keep the size of each service info message down to less than 1300 bytes,
    to allow constrained device protocols to operate correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ServiceInfo exchange in Secure Device Onboard allows the cooperating client entities on
the Device and Owner to negotiate their own “protocol” for setting up the
Device. The names and meanings of key value pairs is generally up to the Device
and Owner, but specific (useful) values are given in section <a href="#to0acceptowner-type-25">§</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>
<p>This message serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Owner begins sending the Ownership Voucher to the device (only the
    header is in this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Owner signs the message with the Owner key (the last key in the
    Ownership Voucher), allowing the Device to verify (later on) that the Owner
    controls this private key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Owner starts the key exchange protocol by sending the initial key
    exchange parameter xA (For example, in Diffie Hellman, the parameter ‘A’) to the
    Device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ownership Voucher’s header is sent in the “oh” and “hmac” tags. The “sz” tag
gives the number of Ownership Voucher Entries. The entries will be sent in
subsequent messages. It is legal for the “sz” tag to have a value of zero (0),
but this is only useful in re-manufacturing situations since the Rendezvous
Service cannot verify (or accept) these Ownership Proxies.</p>
<p>The “hmac” tag is a HMAC-SHA256 (Secure Device Onboard 1.0 and Secure Device Onboard 1.1 protocol spec)
or HMAC-SHA384 (future crypto) over the “oh” tag. The HMAC key is the one that
was created in the Device during the DI Protocol (or stored in the Device, if an
alternate mechanism is used to initialize the Device). The Device re-computes
the HMAC value against the received contents of the “oh” tag using this stored
secret, and verifies that the “hmac” tag has the same value. This ensures that
the Device itself has not been reinitialized since it was originally programmed
during manufacturing.</p>
<p>For ECDSA device attestation method, the New Owner Client includes the hash of
device certificate chain from Ownership Voucher (OP.oh.hdc) in the
TO2.ProveOPHdr message (as TO2.ProveOPHdr.bo.oh.hdc) for the device to verify
the HMAC. The device temporarily saves the oh.hdc on receiving the message. When
the device computes the new HMAC based on the fields received inTO2.SetupDevice
message, it uses the value of TO2.ProveOPHdr.bo.oh.hdc that was previously
saved. The new HMAC is returned to the New Owner Client as part of TO2.Done
message</p>
<p>The public key “pk” is the Owner Key. This key, which verifies the message
signature (“sg”), must be compared with the public key in the last Ownership
Voucher Entry when it is received (later in the sequence of this protocol).<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This key must also be able to verify the signature of the TO1.SDORedirect
message. The Device must store the TO1.SDORedirect message (or its hash) until
the TO2.ProveOPHdr message is received. At this time, the Device can verify the
TO1.SDORedirect signature with the give Owner key in TO2.ProveOPHdr.pk. If the
TO1.SDORedirect signature does not verify, the Device must assume that a man in
the middle is monitoring its traffic, and fail immediately with an error code
message.</p>
<p>The bo.eB field continues the Device’ signing process.</p>
<p>The bo.xA field begins the key exchange protocol. See section <a href="../protocol-description/#key-exchange-in-the-to2-protocol">§</a>  for more
details on key exchange. The key exchange is finished in the TO2.ProveDevice message (section <a href="../detailed-protocol-description/#to2provedevice-type-44">§</a>).</p>
<p>The verification of this message is critical, but may be a little hard to
understand. The Device initially verifies this message’s signature “sg” using
the supplied key “pk”, then saves a copy of this key (for memory reasons, the
Device may save a SHA hash of the key). As the Ownership Voucher entries are
transmitted in successive TO2.GetOPNextEntry messages, the Device can verify
them using the signature chain embedded in the Ownership Voucher, from header to
entry 1 to entry 2, and so on. The last such entry signs bo.pk, which is called
the “owner key”. Now the Device must verify that the Owner can sign with this
bo.pk public key’s corresponding private key. But if this bo.pk matches the
TO2.ProveOPHdr.pk, then the signature verification at the start has verified
exactly this. The following diagram illustrates the process, using only the
signature chain, for an Ownership Voucher 3 entries:</p>

<p>Message Meaning:</p>
<p>This message effects ownership transfer, causing the credentials previously used
to take over the device to be replaced. If we recall the credentials programmed
in the DI protocol, these are now updated based on the new credentials
downloaded from the new Owner.</p>

<p>The “osinn” field gives the number of owner service info messages that will be
transmitted to the Device. The Owner should try to keep the size of each service
info message down to less than 1300 bytes, to allow constrained device protocols
to operate correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Message Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>Contains ServiceInfo key value pairs, transmitted from Owner to Device. The
Owner should send only enough pairs to keep within the likely constraints of the
Device and the protocol. In particular, no more than 1300 bytes of ServiceInfo
should be sent in a single message.</p>
<p>ServiceInfo entries that are duplicated in subsequent messages are <em>appended</em> to
the same named entries at the destination. This makes it possible to send an
arbitrary sized ServiceInfo message.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Message Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>Indicates successful completion of the Transfer of Ownership.</p>
<p>The Client and Owner software now transitions to performing the requested
actions between Device and Owner. For example, the Client can activate the
scripting implicit in the ServiceInfo data structure received from the
Rendezvous Server.</p>
<p>The Device TEE discards and regenerates the secret from the DI Protocol. It then
generates an “hmac” field equivalent to the one in the
[DI.SetHMac] message (see section <a href="#disethmac-type-12">§</a>).</p>
<p>The Owner may use this information to construct a new Ownership Voucher based on
the Owner2 key and the new information configured into the Device in the
TO2.SetupDevice message. This information permits the Owner to effect a new
transfer of ownership by re-enabling the Secure Device Onboard software on the Device.</p>
<p>If the Device does not support resale (see section <a href="../resale-protocol/#resale-protocol">§</a>), and wishes to so
inform the Owner, the HMAC is returned with zero length. It is legal for the
Device to generate a valid HMAC but refuse to support resale at a later time. In
this case, it is highly recommended that an out-of-band mechanism be provided to
let the Owner know that the resale protocols will not work.</p>
<p>If the Device supports Credential Reuse protocol and all the conditions for
Credential Reuse are satisfied in TO2.SetupDevice, then a special value of HMAC
with length 1 is returned (see section ‎<a href="../credential-reuse-protocol/#credential-reuse-protocol">§</a>).</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Message Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>This message provides an opportunity for a final ACK after the Owner has invoked
the System Info block to establish agent-to-server communications between the
Device and its final Owner.</p>
<p>When possible, the TO2.Done2 should be delayed until the Device has established
agent-to-server communications, allowing an Secure Device Onboard error to occur when such
communications fail.</p>
<p>On some constrained devices, Secure Device Onboard software might not be able to run after
the agent-to-server communications are set up. On these systems, this ACK can
happen right after the TO2.Done message. Such systems cannot recover from a
failure that appears after Secure Device Onboard has finished, but that prevents
agent-to-server communications from being established.</p>
<p>Examples of systems that cannot generate a response after agent-to-server
communications are working include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Constrained systems that don’t have enough resources to run both Secure Device Onboard
    and the agent-to-server subsystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systems that require a reboot to complete agent-to-server setup.</p>
