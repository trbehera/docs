The FDO project is developing an implementation of the [FIDO Device Onboard Specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/fido-device-onboard-v1.0-ps-20210323/) by the FIDO Alliance.

The [FDO PRI](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/pri-fidoiot) component has been added to the LF Edge Secure Device Onboard project. It is a reference implementation of the FDO Specification, and also implements the service modules required to exercise the complete system: Device, Manufacturer, Rendezvous Server, and Owner. See the [readme](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/pri-fidoiot/blob/master/README.md) in the PRI-FIDOIOT project repository for details on the implementation and how to get it set up and running.

The [FDO Client SDK](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/client-sdk-fidoiot) component has been added to the LF Edge Secure Device Onboard project. A [design document](fdo-client-sdk-design.md) outlining the changes required to support the new FIDO Device Onboard Specification for devices has also been added to the FDO documentation. Comments are welcome and can be submitted via the FDO documentation GitHub repository.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/release-fidoiot/releases) for a summary of features and capabilities implemented (or not) in different releases.
